.
.SH "NAME"
\fBspec4php\fR \- Spec files
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
A typical spec file:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

<?php
describe "Calculator"
    it "should multiply"
        calculator(1, \'*\', 10) should equal 10
    end
    it "should divide"
        calculator(4, \'/\', 2) should equal 2
    end
end
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
In this example we have grouped (\fBdescribe\fR) two tests (\fBit\fR) where each one has a single expectation (\fBshould\fR)\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Spec files are normal PHP source code files with additional syntax to define \fBblocks\fR and \fBexpectations\fR\. By convention they should end in \fB\.spec\.php\fR or \fBSpec\.php\fR although this is not a requirement\.
.
.P
The custom syntax for Spec can be made compatible with that of PHP by using dots "\." as a replacement for spaces\. This feature is mostly useful when you don\'t want your spec files to report errors in an IDE or when running the files thru a \fIlinting\fR process\.
.
.P
In order to transform the custom Spec syntax to valid (and runnable) PHP source code you\'ll need to use the \fBcompiler\fR component of spec4php(3)\. The command line tool, spec4php(1), takes care of this process and will automatically transform the files\. By default, Spec will register a custom PHP stream wrapper with the prefix \fIspec://\fR which will apply the transformation to any file it references\.
.
.SH "BLOCKS"
These are the different blocks supported\. All of them are to be terminated with the \fBend\fR keyword or enclosed in curly braces\.
.
.TP
\fBdescribe\fR "\fIdescription\fR"
This block allows to define a group of tests\. These blocks can be nested inside other \fBdescribe\fR blocks\. They can be think of as the equivalent of a PHPUnit suite\.
.
.TP
\fBit\fR "\fIdescription\fR"
This is basically a test case\. These blocks MUST appear inside \fBdescribe\fR blocks\. Inside \fBit\fR blocks you should include your test logic an apply expectations over it\. This is the equivalent to a PHPUnit test case method\.
.
.TP
\fBbefore\fR
This block MUST appear inside a \fBdescribe\fR one\. It\'s used to setup the \fIworld\fR for the tests contained in the parent \fBdescribe\fR block\.
.
.TP
\fBafter\fR
This block MUST appear inside a \fBdescribe\fR one\. It\'s used to restore or clean up the \fIworld\fR after all the tests contained in the parent \fBdescribe\fR block have been run\.
.
.TP
\fBbefore_each\fR
Almost the same as the \fBbefore\fR block but this one is run just before every test (\fBit\fR block)\.
.
.TP
\fBafter_each\fR
Almost the same as the \fBafter\fR block but this one is run just after every test (\fBit\fR block)\.
.
.P
Note that \fBbefore_each\fR and \fBafter_each\fR are inherited in nested \fBdescribe\fR groups\.
.
.SH "TEST BLOCKS"
Test blocks are defined with the \fBit\fR keyword\. These blocks should test your code by performing expectations over its functionality\. They are equivalent to PHPUnit\'s TestCase class methods\. In fact, they are wrapped at runtime in a PHPUnit TestCase class\.
.
.P
You can even access the test case class methods by using the \fB$this\fR variable, as you would in a class method\. Spec will automatically translate occurrences of \fB$this\fR inside code blocks and convert them to a call to the underlying test case class instance\. This allows to mix the usage of Spec\'s native expectations and original PHPUnit assertions\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

it "should use asserts"
    $this\->assertEquals(1, 1);
end
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This feature comes really handy when you have an extended PHPUnit test case class, like for example with the Zend_Test classes, without having to port those custom assertions to Spec matchers\. Besides, it will ease the path when converting PHPUnit test cases to Spec, since most of the code used in your current tests will run unmodified when placed in a spec file\.
.
.P
An additional feature of \fBit\fR blocks is their ability to get arguments for the test from their own description string\. Any \fIvalue\fR enclosed in quotes (single or double) or between angle brackets (<>) will be made available inside the code block with variables named \fB$argX\fR, where X is an integer count starting at 1\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

it "should multiply \'100\' by \'10\' and return <1000>" {
    $arg1 * $arg2 should equal $arg3;
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This feature is specially suited to create \fIdynamic\fR tests, something that is a bit more difficult with other testing frameworks\. Since test code blocks are converted to simple anonymous functions, it\'s possible to wrap them in loops to feed a set of data to test\. The following example will create 5 individual tests feeding different data to each one of them\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$results = array(0, 100, 200, 300, 400);
foreach ($results as $i=>$result) {
    it "should multiply \'$i\' by \'100\' and return \'{$result[$i]}\'"
        $arg1 * $arg2 should equal $arg3;
    end
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "WORLD"
All the code blocks (\fBit\fR, \fBbefore\fR, \fBafter\fR, \fBbefore_each\fR and \fBafter_each\fR) get automatic access to an object thru a variable named \fB$W\fR (uppercase W) representing the \fIworld\fR\. Hooks like \fBbefore\fR or \fBbefore_each\fR can be used to configure this \fIworld\fR by initializing variables, resources, database connections, mocks\.\.\.
.
.P
Spec will create and restore \fIsnapshots\fR of this object so that every test (\fBit\fR blocks) in a \fBdescribe\fR group receives the exact same values configured in their \fIworld\fR object\. There are some things that can\'t be automatically restored by Spec though, like database connections or file resources, so try to configure them in \fBbefore\fR hooks instead of \fBbefore_each\fR ones\.
.
.P
Note that since the \fIworld\fR is restored after each test is ran, it\'s not possible to pass values using it from one test to another\. You should always use the hooks to configure the \fIworld\fR, otherwise you would run into problems when tests are executed in a different order or skipped for some reason\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

describe "World"

    before
       $W\->foo = \'bar\';
    end

    before_each
        $W\->foo \.= \'baz\';
    end

    it "should get an initialized world" {
        $W\->foo should equal "barbaz";
    }
end
.
.fi

.
.SH "EXPECTATIONS"
Expectations are defined in Spec by using a subject\-predicate form that mimics english natural language\. Basically they take the form "\fBsubject\fR \fIshould\fR \fBpredicate\fR" where \fBsubject\fR is a PHP expression and \fBpredicate\fR defines matchers and expected values\.
.
.P
Any PHP expressions can be used before \fIshould\fR, however some are not completely supported, for example, it\'s not possible to use anonymous functions as the expectation \fBsubject\fR\. To improve readability and ensure the parser works as expected is useful to wrap them in parenthesis\.
.
.P
Matchers in the \fBpredicate\fR part can have an expected value, any simple PHP expression following the matcher phrase idents will be used as an argument to the matcher function\. If you need to use function calls or other more complex expressions you can wrap them in parenthesis, otherwise the parser might not be able to parse it correctly\.
.
.P
Expectations do not need to be ended with a semicolon character (\';\') when the next word is the \fBend\fR keyword or there is an empty line below it\.
.
.P
In some cases it makes sense to use comparison symbols instead of writing it as text\. See the following table for the mapping between the comparison symbols and their matchers\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

   Symbol     |     Matcher
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
    ===       |    same
    !==       |    not same
    ==        |    equal
    !=        |    not equal
    >         |    greater
    <         |    less
    >=        |    at least
    <=        |    at most
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Additionally, any matcher can be negated by using the word \fBnot\fR in it\.
.
.P
See the following examples of expectations:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$result should be integer;
(1+1) should not equal 1;
trim("  foo ") should be exactly "foo";
count(array(1,2,3)) should >= 2;
$result should equal (1/2 + 5);
1 should not equal 2;
1 should != 2;
"foo" should equal (trim("  foo  "))
true should be ((bool)$var)
.
.fi

.
.SH "COORDINATION"
Complex expectations can be \fIcoordinated\fR by using operators \fBand\fR, \fBor\fR and \fBbut\fR\. It\'s important to understand the operator precedence rules before using them, although they try to follow common conventions for the english language there might be cases where they don\'t quite do what they look like\.
.
.P
All operators are left\-associative and take two operands, thus the precedence rules are very simple:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

  operator  |  precedence index
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
    and     |        3
    or      |        2
    but     |        1
    ,and    |        1
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Please note that it\'s not possible to override the standard precedence rules by using parentheses\. Expectations should be kept simple, when in doubt break up complex expectations into simpler ones\.
.
.P
Please review the following examples to see how these precedence rules apply\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

should be integer or string and equal "1"
(integer) OR (string AND equal "1")

\-\- Note that a comma followed by an operand behaves like an "or"
should be integer, float or string
(integer) OR (float) OR (string)
should be integer, string and equal to 10 or float
(integer) OR (string AND equal 10) OR (float)

\-\- Note that a comma followed by "and" behaves like a "but"
should be integer or string but less than 10
should be integer or string, and less than 10
(integer OR string) AND (less than 10)

should be integer or string and equal 0 or float
(integer) OR (string AND equal 0) OR (float)

should be integer or string and equal "1" but not be a float
( (integer) OR (string AND equal "1") ) AND (not be float)

\-\- Note that if no matchers are given the last one is used
should be equal to 10, 20 or 30
(equal 10) OR (equal 20) OR (equal 30)

.
.SH "ANNOTATIONS"
Annotations can be defined in two ways, using the standard javadoc like comment with \fB@tag\fR entries or a more lightweight alternative using a hash line comment followed by a word: \fB# tag\fR\.
.
.P
Most annotations are inherited by child \fBdescribe\fR groups and \fBit\fR blocks\. In the case where there is a collision the deepest one in the hierarchy wins\.
.
.P
Spec understands the following annotation tags:
.
.TP
\fBclass\fR \fIclass_name\fR
Tells Spec to create a test case inheriting from the given class\. This is very useful to allow the use of Spec with custom TestCase classes you might already have or for enabling the use of Zend_Test or PHPUnit\'s Selenium test case implementation\.
.
.TP
\fBthrows\fR [\fIcode\fR] \fIclass\fR [\fImessage\fR]
This annotation instructs Spec to perform an additional assertion when runnning the test, ensuring that it should throw an exception matching the given code or the given exception class\.
.
.TP
\fBtodo\fR, \fBincomplete\fR
Flags a test case as incomplete\. Spec will report these test cases in a different way to standard ones, so it\'s easy to know when a test is passing but doesn\'t yet tests all the functionality it should\.
.
.TP
\fBskip\fR
A test case with this tag will make Spec skip its execution but log in the report that it was skipped\. It\'s a great way to disable some test cases known to fail for any reason\.
.
.P
Additionally, most PHPUnit annotations should work when using spec files too, see PHPUnit documentation \fIhttp://www\.phpunit\.de/manual/current/en/appendixes\.annotations\.html\fR
.
.SH "GOTCHAS"
Spec will load the spec files via a custom stream wrapper which provokes \fB__DIR__\fR and \fB__FILE__\fR magic constants to include the stream prefix in them\. Often times it\'s needed to load files relative to the spec file location, in these cases we would usually use the \fB__DIR__\fR constant\. Spec takes this into account and will automatically convert this constant to calls to \fBSpec::dir(__DIR__)\fR which returns a normalized version of the value\. For \fB__FILE__\fR however there is no special threatment, so if you use code like \fBdirname(__FILE__)\fR please update it to use the \fB__DIR__\fR one\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

// /path/to/fixtures/class\.php
include __DIR__ \. \'/fixtures/class\.php\';
// /path/to/fixtures/data\.txt
$data = file_get_contents(__DIR__ \. \'/fixtures/data\.txt\');
// spec://fixtures/data\.txt
$data = file_get_contents(dirname(__FILE__) \. \'/fixtures/data\.txt\');
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Note that including spec files from another spec file is not officially supported yet\. It might work in some cases but it\'s desirable to layout your tests using individual files to avoid conflicts and erroneous behavior\.
.
.SH "CUSTOM TEST CLASSES"
It\'s possible to use custom test case classes that extend the \fBPHPUnit_Framework_TestCase\fR one\. They can be implemented by you or come from a framework, like the ones from Zend_Test\.
.
.P
Spec is able to \fIpatch\fR any given class to add support for its features, so it\'s completely possible to use those classes without having to modify them in any way\.
.
.P
The way to tell Spec what class it should use is by defining an annotation for a \fBdescribe\fR or \fBit\fR block, like in the following example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# class Zend_Test_PHPUnit_ControllerTestCase
describe "Calculator"
  it "should multiply" {
    (1*3) should equal 3;
  }

  // @class PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
  it "should divide"
    (3/1) should equal 3;
  end
end
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Note that this annotation is inherited by child blocks, so there is no need to specify it for each test\.
